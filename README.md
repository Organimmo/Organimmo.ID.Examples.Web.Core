# Example - Secure a website with Organimmo ID

This example explains how you can secure a website with our Organimmo identity server and generate an access token to communicate with an Organimmo endpoint (API).

Our identity server uses the [OAUTH2](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID](https://openid.net/what-is-openid/) open standards.

#### Requirements

1. Visual studio
2. [.NET Core 2.1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
3. Application credentials + various settings

#### Request access

Every application must be registered in the Organimmo tenant. You can request access by sending an email to [support@organimmo.be](mailto:support@organimmo.be) with following items:
